== Installation ==

= Requirements =

The Pronamic iDEAL plugin extends WordPress extensions with the iDEAL 
payment method. To offer the iDEAL payment method to the vistors of
your WordPress website you also require one of these extensions. Normally
this is an e-commerce or forms plugin. 

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file 
transfers itself and you donât need to leave your web browser. To do an 
automatic install of Pronamic iDEAL, log in to your WordPress dashboard, 
navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type âPronamic iDEALâ and click Search Plugins. Once 
youâve found our iDEAL plugin you can view details about it such as the the 
point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can 
install it by simply clicking âInstall Nowâ.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our iDEAL plugin and 
uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. 
The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you 
backup your site just in case.

== Are there any known plugin conflicts? ==

Unfortunately WordPress is notorious for conflicts between themes and plugins. It is unavoidable as you have no control over what other plugins and themes do. While we do take steps to avoid conflicts as best we can, we have no control over other plugins or themes.

As conflicts are found we will update this list. If you discover a conflict with a another plugin, please notify us.

Here is a list of known plugin conflicts:

*	**WordPress HTTPS**
	The WordPress HTTPS can conflict with the OmniKassa payment method. It can 
	cause invalid signature errors. The WordPress HTTPS plugin parses the complete 
	output of an WordPress website and changes 'http' URLs to 'https' URLs, this 
	results in OmniKassa data that no longer matches the signature.

== To Do ==

*	Qantani - Check Callback URL implementation.
*	Mollie - Add unit tests for new API.
